Docker deployment
=================

This directory contains everything to deploy an XWHEP platform.

Docker images for all services must exist. 
You can create Docker images there:
- [server image](../server/)
- [worker image](../worker/)
- [client image](../client/)


# Docker deployment

We propose a script to automate a deployment made of a server, a worker and a client

Make your deployement by launching docker.sh like:
```
  docker.sh
```


# Docker-compose deployment
