We propose 3 Dockerfile to create images for the server, the client and the worker.
These Dockerfile respectively need the debian package for the server, the client and the worker.
These debian packages are automatically created by the "xwconfigure" script
You must copy the debian package in the Dockerfile directory to build the image
